frequency range provide high capacity data speed needed new use case discussed course proponent wi fi used similar argument regard need higher frequency also make case societal benefit arguably even

business china largest consumer integrated circuit ic since state council china adopted ambitious plan china electronics industry become self reliant made china plan set strategic goal grow country ic industry achieve self sufficiency rate increasing three year later china importing chip fewer according national imported key commodity value index published state general administration custom china imported billion integrated circuit total amount rmb billion u billion increase first time china ic import exceeded u billion market china try win obstacle china achieving chip self sufficiency given china lack internal source basic device ip electronic design automation eda tool semiconductor manufacturing equipment china create path achieve semiconductor self sufficiency guest chinese semiconductor industry china ic leader summit roundtable discussed unavoidable problem encountered development china ic industry offered advice various perspective proceed developing home grown industry market must goal improving self sufficiency area must domestic semiconductor industry chain dr wayne dai verisilicon ceo belief key solve bottleneck huge amount memory product required andy miao deputy general manager technical director shenzhen micro semicon agreed storage market china making good progress market easier break contrast microcontroller mcu u billion market still hand international manufacturer chinese company reduce reliance import long term process including upgrading level analog technology quality control said andy miao deputy general manager technical director shenzhen micro semicon invest foreign tech keep low key miao also pointed premise self sufficiency rate china would gain control technology needed order vault ahead could include directly purchasing foreign technology however ic industry strategic technology country ownership politically sensitive best act low key term investment acquisition present important goal accumulate basic skill put number aside take step step rush success miao said yanqiu xia director strategy business development hisilicon belief figure guideline government still necessary achieve result however company must set goal like parent want child admitted prestigious school right parent decide rely child internal drive like company goal perhaps going stick xia said company start reach already achieved great success goal set specific company enterprise upgrade competitiveness continuously evolve develop strive achieve result su weimin chairman zigbee member group china spoke perspective standard body chip basis communication although chip manufacturer currently certified zigbee alliance worldwide one chinese company certified said weimin nonetheless field communication chinese chip manufacturer made significant progress wei xu secretary shanghai integrated circuit industry association sica executive vice president shanghai hhgrace semiconductor manufacturing corporation hope cooperation among electronics company china bring increase self sufficiency rate chip ic industry chain long design manufacturing packaging testing material said single country dominate world china consider integrity construction industrial chain completely closed environment country began build fabs progress perspective capacity localization rate chip make great progress wei xu secretary sica executive vice president shanghai hhgrace semiconductor manufacturing corp open man land innovation king might opportunity chinese electronics company compete foreign manufacturer joining starting line man land market still new example artificial intelligence ai driverless vehicle market industry market standard relatively infancy china industry exploit opportunity develop chip architecture related technological ecosystem dai said could profitable look opportunity edge market example belief smart audio wireless headphone could entry point example wireless headphone also used hearing aid new product yet widely available bright prospect would represent large quantity xu said post moore law era application driver could advantage chinese electronics industry china could leverage huge internal market set worldwide trend determine standard whole world future application include area smart city healthcare country large population likely creative mindset atmosphere miao agreed dai xu look opportunity edge biggest driving force design innovation come terminal performance system requirement china successful manufacturing country huawei example creates internet thing iot platform big enough set standard certain standard formed chinese company good chance achieve leadership miao noted especially field home appliance industrial control iot land first direct place human computer interaction also best field chinese manufacturer including haier midea gree gree home appliance already taken lead world system home appliance manufacturer need cooperate chip manufacturer optimizing

standard depends outcome market competition many game involved one reason many people use google tensor processing unit tpu concerned google ability continue leading market meanwhile small company open source something might produce innovative product still might get market traction product good suspicion small company might resource continue innovating next year next year year xia added set standard new field think following international mainstream manufacturer one belief chinese manufacturer defeat apple google within year must aim five year plan goal high action deterred competition lead entire industry chain establish called standard order continue compete weimin also belief emphasis national autonomy might effective strategy context globalization domestically enforced standard forced chinese company neglect cooperation international community closed system country enterprise set standard example china high speed railway system operates largely su weimin chairman zigbee
